# odin-recipes
A website I'm creating containing a recipe (The Odin Project)
This is my first projet for The Odin Project - I will be creating a website which will host some basic recipes and I will create this using HTML. The skills I am going to demonstrate are my HTML sklls and my linux terminal skills, I will also need to constantly commit whenever I make some changes on here.
