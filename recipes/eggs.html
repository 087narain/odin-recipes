        <h4>The process behind cooking eggs</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</li>
            <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Do not allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs</li>
            <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan</li>
            <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
            <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>
        </ol>
